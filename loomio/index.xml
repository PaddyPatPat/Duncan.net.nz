			<content>Few people experience working in a group where everyone actually gets a meaningful chance to participate in the decisions that group makes. Or, to look at it from the converse, most of us belong to groups where we actually don't have that much of a say in what the group does. This isn't to say that big groups never manage to make coherent decisions using the tools we have. Reddit.com is constantly spawning all kinds of collective actions, like online fundraisers for people who need expensive medical operations or flash-mobs around media moments. </content>

			<content>Left to their own devices, most groups don't have a clue how to govern themselves effectively. When you encourage people to get together and form groups, you're essentially setting them up to get bogged down in process and power struggles that make people never want to be part of a movement again. If there was some way to scale good group process, it could be very helpful in facilitating self-organizing. </content>

			<content>None of today's online tools - email, list-servs, blogs, chats, wikis - are built to make it easy for large groups to make decisions together. Groups make do with what they have and members put up with communication annoyances constantly (or, as many organizers know, they drift away because ongoing communications can be a drag). </content>

			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>If tools like email are bad for hammering out consensus among disparate views, maybe it's no wonder the Internet seems to be much better at mobilizing "stop" energy than at galvanizing "go" energy. It's much easier to rally around an obvious consensus that may already be shared--"Stop X" from happening--than it is to use the internet to build a new shared agreement, even among a group of people who already may think they have a lot in common. And while our brains' wiring and our cultural inheritances may explain a lot of this problem, at least part of it is also due to bad tools. </content>

			<reference>&OnlineOnBooze;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>Loomio shows discussions on the left and decisions on the right. </content>
		</attribution>
	</p>
	<p>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&LoomioTheKiwiWebAppToDemocratiseDecisionMaking;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>It provides a central place for discussions while positioning the proposal at the top of the screen to keep the discussion on topic. Member summary statements let everyone get their views in. </content>
		</attribution>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&CanSocialSoftwareChangeTheWorldLoomioJustMight;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>It's easy for anyone in a Loomio group to initiate a topic for conversation. It's also easy for a group member to form a sub-group, like a committee that works on a narrower topic area. </content>
		</attribution>
	</p>
	<p>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&CanSocialSoftwareChangeTheWorldLoomioJustMight;</reference>
			<contributor>&BenKnight;</contributor>
			<content>It's important to build shared understanding before a decision is reached by the group. This means that when you get to the outcome, it's not that everyone has to agree to the outcome, they just have to agree that its the best outcome the group can reach at that time. </content>
		</attribution>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&LoomioCelsiasNewZealand;</reference>
			<contributor>&BenKnight;</contributor>
			<content>It's also important that members do not come to a decision until the discussion has aired all points of view. Everyone has an opportunity to raise any concerns, and collaboratively develop their thinking as a group. This unlocking of collective wisdom leads groups to arrive at better decisions than anyone would have made on their own. </content>
		</attribution>
	</p>
	<p>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&CanSocialSoftwareChangeTheWorldLoomioJustMight;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>When people are ready to make decisions, it's easy for any group member to offer a proposal up for a vote. They can choose to vote either yes, no, abstain or block. </content>
		</attribution>	
		<attribution>
			<reference>&OnlineOnBooze;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>Beside each decision is displayed the deadline for that decision as well as a pie graph showing the level of agreement. </content>
		</attribution>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&CanSocialSoftwareChangeTheWorldLoomioJustMight;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>This means that at any point in the conversation about a decision, members of the group can see what the group as a whole is thinking. </content>
		</attribution>
		<attribution>
			<reference>&OnlineOnBooze;</reference>
			<contributor>&PatrickDuncan;</contributor>
			<content>Finally, when users "vote" on an idea they also leave a brief Twitter-length summary, so the result is not just the hard numbers but a summary of everyone's concerns. </content>
