Duncan.net.nz
=============

Duncan.net.nz is a holding site for the development of a new collaborative content creation platform. 

The intention is to allow multiple authors to have the content they add associated with them. This allows for reimbursement to split between authors fairly based off the percentage they have each contributed to an article.

Current systems usually associate the whole document to one or more authors. Or, in the case of wikis, authors' contributions are not recognised at all. This system uses xml documents to wrap each part of the document in references to its one or more contributors and to the references that back up it's point of view.

Changing how authors are reimbursed is the first part of a plan to reboot how we structure our communities. Shared understanding is the glue that holds together members of each community and allows for decision making to be vote based rather than enclosed in hierarchies. Through changing how we tell our stories and how we structure the content that so often is the basis for learning, we can have a significant impact on the sensibleness and cohesion of communities of any size.
