Duncan.net.nz
=============

Duncan.net.nz is a holding site for the development of a new collaborative content creation platform. 

The intention is to allow multiple authors to have the content they add associated with them. This allows for reimbursement to split between authors fairly based off the percentage they have each contributed to an article.

Current systems usually associate the whole document to one or more authors. Or, in the case of wikis, authors' contributions are not recognised at all. This system uses xml documents to wrap each part of the document in references to its one or more contributors and to the references that back up it's point of view.

Changing how authors are reimbursed is the first part of a plan to reboot how we structure our communities. Shared understanding is the glue that holds together members of each community and allows for decision making to be vote based rather than enclosed in hierarchies. Through changing how we tell our stories and how we structure the content that so often is the basis for learning, we can have a significant impact on the sensibleness and cohesion of communities of any size.

To Do List:
-----------
The list here is semi-ordered so that the things at the top are often simpler or more pressing to get done.

* Add a menu to the website so that each of the documents currently available can be seen.
* 
* Add a percentage beside each contributors name in the document, specifying how much they have contributed.
* Add a way for images to be added into the content. Each image needs to be wrapped in contributor and reference code like the text is.
* Change contributors who were quoted into quotes so that people can be recognised for adding quotes to the current content.
* Change how the percentage contributed is calculated so that the majority of the contribution (80% for the moment) is given to the reference and quote for the content, rather than the contributor who added it here. This is still far too much to the contributor but considering how much content is already out there is seems to be better to promote combining content together over creating new work.
* Figure out how to add nested content with each paragraph to replace the existing Disqus comment system. Each piece of nested content should be able to be as capable as it's parent document. The intention is to allow for the focusing of discussions as each piece goes further down. Probably this is going to require that the referencing and contribution display on the right side of the screen becomes hidden in some way.
* Work out how people will be able to edit documents by cutting and pasting content without losing all the references. Is it possible to do this in a way where the contributors is not visible to the editing users so that they can just apply references and not mess with who said what?
* Work out how to have changes reversible so that changes in the document can be reversed in order to undo additions that are poor or spam.
* On the organisation side, the website needs to be transferred into a cooperative company, probably under New Zealand law. It needs it's constitution edited and available to others. When the cooperative is formed, this would be a good time to move the website to a new domain name more suitable for it's continued development as a community owned project. 
* PaddyPatPat has a lot of writing on the subject that can be dumped into the system as the system becomes capable of handling this content. The main requirement will be to get rid of Disqus and perhaps to have the revision history facility in place.
